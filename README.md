# Hospitality Revenue Intelligence – AtliQ Grands
**Portfolio Case Study | Power BI**

---

## Project Overview
This repository contains a portfolio case study focused on hospitality revenue analytics. The project demonstrates how structured booking and property data can be analyzed using business intelligence techniques to evaluate performance, define industry-specific KPIs, and derive insight-driven conclusions.

The analysis is intentionally framed as an **analyst-led case study**, with emphasis on data modeling, KPI design, and interpretation rather than operational deployment or real-world implementation.

---

## Analytical Objective
The objective of this project was to explore how hospitality data can be structured and analyzed to:

- Measure revenue efficiency using industry-standard KPIs
- Compare performance across properties, cities, and categories
- Examine the relationship between occupancy, pricing, and revenue
- Identify patterns related to booking behavior and revenue leakage

---

## Data Summary
The analysis is based on structured hospitality datasets, including:

- Booking-level transactional data
- Aggregated room capacity and utilization data
- Property metadata (city, category)
- Room classifications and date dimensions

These datasets support both granular analysis and high-level benchmarking across multiple dimensions.

---

## Analytical Approach

### Data Preparation & Modeling
- Data cleaning and transformation performed using **Power Query**
- Domain-specific assumptions applied (e.g., hospitality weekend definition)
- A **star schema** data model implemented to ensure scalable and consistent analysis

### KPI Framework
Hospitality KPIs were defined and calculated using **DAX**, including:
- Revenue
- ADR (Average Daily Rate)
- RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room)
- Occupancy Percentage
- Realization Percentage
- Cancellation Percentage

These KPIs form the foundation of all insights presented in the dashboard and report.

---

## Key Insights (High-Level)
- Revenue and RevPAR vary significantly across properties, even within the same city
- High occupancy does not always translate into high pricing efficiency
- Weekends consistently outperform weekdays in both occupancy and revenue efficiency
- Booking behavior and cancellations contribute to measurable revenue leakage

Detailed interpretations and supporting visuals are documented in the accompanying slide deck.
